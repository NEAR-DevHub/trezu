# Background jobs (apalis)

All recurring backend workers are organized with [apalis](https://github.com/apalis-dev/apalis)
(1.0.0-rc): each job is an apalis worker fed by an `apalis-cron` schedule
piped into a per-job Postgres queue (`apalis.jobs` in the app database).
See `src/jobs/` — `mod.rs` (registration/schedules) and `handlers.rs`
(one thin handler per job wrapping the existing per-cycle function).

What this replaces: 17 hand-rolled `tokio::spawn` + interval loops in
`main.rs`. What it adds, uniformly:

- task history, results, and errors persisted per queue
- a web UI (apalis-board) to inspect queues/workers and trigger any job
  manually (PUT a task into its queue)
- per-task tracing spans; `concurrency(1)` guarantees cycles never overlap
- failed cycles are visible as failed tasks instead of just log lines

## Resilience

Every web replica prepares the Apalis schema and queue registry, but only the
replica holding the PostgreSQL session advisory lock `(0x54525A55, 1)` starts
workers. The elected replica holds one pooled connection for its complete
leadership session; followers release unsuccessful connections immediately,
continue serving HTTP, and retry election with jittered exponential backoff
(2s→30s). PostgreSQL automatically releases the lock if the leader process or
connection dies.

The leader runs all cron workers under one Apalis `Monitor` and starts the three
public-history payload consumers (`public_history_latest`,
`public_history_readiness`, and `public_history_backfill`) in the same
leadership session. This prevents a rolling deployment from creating a second
scheduler or a second fixed-name payload worker. Startup tasks are pushed only
on the first leadership acquisition per process and are skipped when an active
task for that queue already exists.

Failure containment and coordinated shutdown have four layers:

1. **Task errors** — the failure is recorded and the next cron tick starts
   a fresh task. One bad cycle never stops the schedule. There is
   deliberately **no automatic task-level retry**: several handlers have
   non-idempotent side effects (on-chain `payout_batch` / `claim` txs,
   Telegram sends), so re-running the whole handler on any error could
   duplicate them. The cron schedule *is* the retry. The platform claim
   backend retries transient database errors with jittered 1s→30s backoff.
2. **Handler panics** — `catch_panic` turns a panic into a task error
   (same path as #1) instead of tearing the worker down.
3. **Worker exit** — if a worker's run loop exits on a sustained
   backend/storage failure, the `Monitor`'s `should_restart` hook rebuilds
   and restarts it (the factory gets a fresh connection); a clean exit on
   shutdown is honoured, so in-flight tasks drain instead of being fought by
   a restart. The whole set runs on one supervised task and stops together
   on **`SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`** (`run_with_signal`) — SIGTERM being what
   containers/systemd send for a graceful stop.
4. **Replica exit or leadership loss** — a five-second heartbeat verifies the
   lock-owning connection. A heartbeat failure or unexpected runtime exit
   cancels and drains the complete worker runtime before leadership is
   reacquired. Graceful shutdown explicitly unlocks before returning the
   connection to the pool; any unlock failure closes the connection instead,
   so a lock-bearing session is never reused.

Rebuilt cron backends delay their first claim with jittered exponential
backoff (1s→30s), preventing Apalis's synchronous restart hook from becoming a
hot loop. Claim-query database failures remain inside the backend and use the
same bounds without exiting the worker. The public-history payload consumers
also retry every unexpected worker-loop exit with jittered exponential backoff
(1s→30s), including `WORKER_ALREADY_EXISTS` as a final safeguard and terminal
database/TLS disconnects. Ordinary task-handler failures remain task results
inside Apalis and do not restart a consumer. A shared shutdown token cancels
election/backoff sleeps and lets active workers drain without delaying HTTP
readiness or shared HTTP clients.

The durable `background_job_leader` row records the current generation and
heartbeat for operations. `/api/health` reports both the local role and global
leadership record without making followers unhealthy. The authenticated
`/api/jobs/health` endpoint returns 503 if the global heartbeat is more than 30
seconds old; production uptime monitoring must call it at least once per
minute. One connection is reserved for leadership and one shared connection
fans PostgreSQL insert notifications out to the latency-critical queues. A
pool below four connections logs a startup warning.

## Claim latency and recovery

Every registered queue uses the same `QueueSpec` policy and worker-side
PostgreSQL backend. Empty queues are checked once per second with no adaptive
idle backoff; a non-empty batch is drained immediately. Database errors alone
use jittered exponential backoff. Fetch batch size equals worker concurrency,
so a worker cannot strand a large prefetched set in `Queued`. Latest and
readiness also subscribe to the single shared PostgreSQL listener for normal
sub-second wake-up, while polling remains the missed-notification fallback.

After a stable worker id registers, the backend repairs locks left by its dead
predecessor before allowing the first new claim. Predecessor `Queued` rows are
returned to `Pending`; predecessor `Running` rows are marked `Killed` because
their side effects are ambiguous. Both have their locks cleared, which fences
late predecessor acknowledgements, and every mutation is audited. This startup
barrier also applies to the emergency adaptive-poller fallback. The platform
does not run Apalis's generic orphan retry because it requeues `Running` work;
the state-aware startup recovery and minute reclaimer are authoritative.

`apalis-reclaimer` evaluates registered namespaces every minute in batches of
256. It never deletes old `Pending` work. A `Queued` claim older than five
minutes is returned to `Pending` without incrementing attempts; a `Running`
claim older than the greater of twice its handler timeout or one hour becomes
`Killed`, because its side effects are ambiguous. Enforced changes are written
to `background_job_reclaims` for seven days. Set
`APALIS_RECLAIMER_MODE=report` for dry-run rollout or `enforce` to recover;
the default is report-only.

For a queue-level canary, set `APALIS_STEADY_POLLER_QUEUES` to a comma-separated
allowlist. Without an allowlist the steady backend is enabled globally; set
`APALIS_STEADY_POLLER_ENABLED=false` for the one-release emergency fallback to
Apalis's legacy adaptive poller.

`/api/jobs/health` reports status depths, free slots, oldest runnable/locked
ages, 15-minute start-latency p50/p95/max, and hourly reclaim counts. It labels
failures as `wake`, `capacity`, `claim_stuck`, `execution_stuck`, `progress`,
or `reclaim_rate`, so provider throughput pressure is not confused with a
worker that failed to notice work.

Leadership guarantees one active scheduler/runtime during normal operation.
Task processing itself remains at-least-once: after a crash, Apalis may retry a
task whose completion was not persisted, so handlers still need their existing
idempotency and deduplication protections.

Public silver and gold projection remain idle for a DAO until all three rows in
`bronze_public_history_cursors` (`nearblocks_ft`, `nearblocks_mt`, and
`nearblocks_receipt`) have `backfill_done = true`. Public API reads stay on
legacy `balance_changes` by default; setting `UNIFIED_GOLD_LEDGER_READS=true`
routes public DAOs (activity, charts, and asset balances) to
`gold_treasury_ledger_events`.

Gold projection values recent ordinary transfers from the in-memory latest-price
snapshot, without a database or external request. Historical rows and recent
rows whose token has no cached price keep NULL USD amounts until the ordered
`gold-usd-enrichment` job fills them. Exchange quote USD remains authoritative.

Handlers that do several steps run **all** steps and aggregate failures
rather than aborting on the first error (e.g. notifications detect +
dispatch, monthly credit reset + export expiry, FT-lockup refresh +
claims); the goldsky drain reports partial progress on a mid-drain failure
(its cursor is persisted per batch). Startup migrations for apalis are
tracked in a private `apalis_migrations` schema so they never collide with
the app's own `_sqlx_migrations`.

## Error reporting (Sentry)

Each worker carries apalis's own `SentryLayer` (feature `sentry`, sharing
the same `sentry-core` as the app's `sentry` crate, so it uses the global
hub initialised in `observability.rs`). Per task it:

- opens a Sentry performance transaction (APM), and
- on failure, `capture_error`s the actual error with the `queue`, task id,
  and attempt as Sentry context — better grouping and filtering than a
  formatted log line.

It's layered *outside* `catch_panic`, so a failure is reported **once**,
including panics (which `catch_panic` turns into errors). To avoid
double-reporting, the per-task tracing layer logs failures at `WARN`
instead of the default `ERROR` (a failed cycle is retried by the next cron
tick, so it's a warning); that keeps the generic `tracing → Sentry` bridge
from emitting a second event for the same failure. `SentryLayer` is a no-op when
`SENTRY_DSN` is unset. Worker-level errors (a worker exiting / being
restarted by the monitor) are still logged at `ERROR` and reach Sentry via
that bridge.

## Web UI

The apalis-board (UI + its REST API at `/api/v1`) is served on the main
HTTP service — same listener/port as the rest of the API, like the
warnings admin pages — as the router's `fallback_service`. Every board
route is behind **HTTP Basic Auth** using the same `ADMIN_USERS`
credentials as the warnings admin pages; with `ADMIN_USERS` unset the
board returns `401` for all requests. Unknown public `/api/*` paths keep
returning a plain `404` (the board only owns `/api/v1`).

## Queues

`DISABLE_PUBLIC_TREASURY_WORKERS=true` (confidential-only deployments such as
near.com) skips every queue marked *public-only* below: the NearBlocks
per-account history queues plus `public-history-latest-dispatcher`,
`public-history-readiness-scheduler`, `public-history-backfill-scheduler`,
`public-silver-projection`, `public-gold-projection`,
`public-proposal-reconciliation`, `public-quote-status-refresh`,
`staking-observation`, `dao-list-sync`, `public-dashboard-refresh` and
`ft-lockup-refresh`. `public-history-scheduler` (the Goldsky detector) stays
registered because it also stamps confidential intents and links confidential
proposals; with the flag set it stops seeding public latest-refresh demands.

## Behavior changes vs the old loops

- Intervals are now cron-aligned (e.g. "every 60s" fires on minute
  boundaries) instead of relative to process start; "initial delay" env
  vars are gone — the first cron tick is at most one interval after boot,
  and startup-run jobs get an explicit boot task instead.
- `dao-policy-dirty` runs every 5s instead of every 1s.
- A single apalis migration set (`PostgresStorage::setup`) creates the
  `apalis` schema in the app database at boot (idempotent).
- Multiple backend replicas coordinate through PostgreSQL leadership; only
  the active leader produces cron ticks or consumes payload queues.
