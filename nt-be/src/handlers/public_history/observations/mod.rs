//! Staking pool observations: 90-day backfill plus daily capture.
//!
//! Rewards accrue every epoch with no transaction, so a historical staked
//! series can only come from reading pool state — live for today, archival
//! for the chart horizon (90 daily + 53 weekly boundaries). Readings are
//! stored in `bronze_balance_observations` (provenance; recomputes never
//! re-hit archival RPC) and applied as hidden `observation` ledger entries
//! on the synthetic `staking:{pool}` asset, which flow into the unified
//! table and charts. Boundaries whose archival block cannot be resolved or
//! fetched are skipped — coverage stays incomplete rather than fabricated,
//! and chart readiness waits for it.
//!
//! Rate limits, measured against the configured FastNear archival endpoint:
//! no throttling observed (10-parallel burst all-200); throughput is bounded
//! by ~0.8s round-trip latency. Backfill is ~143 calls per pool one-time,
//! then 1 call/pool/day — sequential reads with a small courtesy delay and a
//! per-cycle cap keep us far below any realistic ceiling.
