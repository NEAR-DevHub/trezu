//! Operator controls for DAOs whose public-history backfill volume is
//! disproportionate: stop the bronze pipeline entirely, or clamp an account
//! to the current chain head instead of walking its full history.
//!
//! Scoped deliberately narrow: only `monitored_accounts.history_ingestion_paused_at`
//! and the bronze/silver/gold public-history pipeline are touched. Proposal
//! refresh, DAO policy sync, balance-monitor maintenance, verification, and
//! confidential monitoring all key off `monitored_accounts.enabled`, which
//! this module never writes.
//!
//! Readers that report ledger coverage or verify running-balance invariants
//! must scope to rows at/after `bronze_public_history_cursors.capped_at_block_height`
//! for a capped account — see `verification/repository.rs::load_asset_ledger_heads`
//! and `charts/repository.rs`'s `ledger_coverage_start`, which both do this.
//!
//! The silver projector needs the same awareness for a different reason:
//! `silver/worker.rs::project_public_silver_for_account` skips an account
//! entirely until `backfill_done`, so for a mid-backfill account (the
//! primary reason to clamp one) silver has never run at all. The moment a
//! clamp flips `backfill_done`, that account's first-ever projection would
//! otherwise recompute from `earliest_bronze_time` — a from-scratch replay
//! of a known-partial bronze slice, seeded from nothing, completely
//! bypassing this module's anchor. `silver/repository.rs::load_capped_at_time`
//! plus the floor on `recompute_from` in `silver/worker.rs` is what makes
//! the anchor actually load-bearing instead of decorative.
