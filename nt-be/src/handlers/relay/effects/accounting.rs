//! Usage accounting for a relay: reserve/refund a gas credit, track `paid_near`, and

//!
//! The gas credit is reserved **atomically before any sponsor spend** (see
//! [`reserve_gas_credit`]) so that concurrent relays for the same treasury cannot all
//! pass a stale credit check and double-spend a single credit. `paid_near` and metrics
//! are recorded in the background — non-critical, and a failure there never affects the
